The AIMS network has five centers of excellence teaching a Masters in Mathematical Sciences, including a work integrated option with a direct link to industry in three centers. Currently, the network has over 2,400 alumni from 44 African countries of which 33% are women. The network also includes research centers and programs with 90 researchers including six prestigious Chairs currently across the network. In Cameroon and Rwanda, AIMS is runs a gender-responsive teacher training program. As well, AIMS created two critical initiatives: Quantum Leap Africa to prepare Africa for the coming quantum revolution, and the Next Einstein Forum to propel Africa on to the global scientific stage.\n",
